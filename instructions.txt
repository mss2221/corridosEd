template instructions  ( * in progress *)

Ready to use, just switch out your own MEI files and edit the header accordingly.
Update with your own data in the _config.yml.

(If you need to encode your music resources,
see this excellent step-by-step tutorial:
https://dlfteach.pubpub.org/pub/intro-mei/release/1)

If you have already created the MEI files you need,
see the example page with instructions in the
`templates` folder in `_drafts` : `samplePiecePage.md`

USING TEMPLATE TO CREATE PERSONAL JEKYLL SITE:

Fork the repository then clone onto your computer.

Change the name to something appropriate for your project.

Switch to `gh-pages` branch.

Install Jekyll in the folder:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

(If absolutely new to Jekyll and GitHub,
please try this tutorial:
https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages

If Jekyll does not serve the website:

- attend carefully to any error messages in the terminal
  and perform any suggested actions.

- try Jekyll troubleshooting https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/.
- also try Jekyll Talk https://talk.jekyllrb.com/.

- if you still cannot find a solution,
    - try copying error message and pasting into browser search bar,
    - or in the search box on Stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/)

Follow instructions in _config.yml

Place MEI files in `data/mei/`

Use samplePiecePage.md as model for making
pages for each MEI file in the mei directory.
These files are kept in the `_texts` folder.

The search page is optional. Put it into the
`_drafts` folder if you don't need it.
