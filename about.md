This test site is a demonstration of viable workflows to transform printed music to digial formats for computer assisted analyais, while providing a simple interface browsing the scores visually and aurally.

Music and text taken from _El corrido mexicano_, compiled and edited by Vicente T. Mendoza (1954).

Music originally entered by hand into Sibelius, exported as MusicXML, then transformed to MEI so that it can be viewable and playable in the browser with Verovio, a music notation engraving library that outputs svg of the score as well as a MIDI stream.

While the original scores were entered by hand, they are fairly clear and simple and could well have been digitized by currently available OCR packages. This is the most time consuming step of creating the repository. All other procedures were automated: export to XML, transform to MEI, html page generation, score display, and sound stream.

All material on this website is drawn directly from files in the repository, and all file types are generated from a single transcription using Sibelius.
